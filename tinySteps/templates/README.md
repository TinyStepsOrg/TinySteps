# Templates Directory

This directory contains all the frontend templates that are shown to users of the TinySteps application. These templates create the user interface that visitors interact with when using the application.

## Purpose

The templates in this folder are responsible for:
- Rendering the visual components of the application
- Handling the user interface elements
- Displaying data retrieved from the backend
- Collecting user input to send to the backend

## Interaction with Backend

These frontend templates interact with the backend API located in the `/api` directory. The templates send requests to the API endpoints and display the responses to provide a seamless user experience.

The frontend-backend interaction typically follows this pattern:
1. User interacts with a template
2. Template sends a request to the appropriate API endpoint
3. Backend processes the request and returns data
4. Template renders the response for the user

This separation of concerns between frontend (templates) and backend (API) helps maintain a clean and maintainable codebase.
